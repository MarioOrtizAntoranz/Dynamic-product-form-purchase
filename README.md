# Dynamic-product-form-purchase
Dynamic product form purchase

<p>This project is a form with three products which the user can choose. 
Every product has a dynamic price based on shipping and price values for each country.
Price and shipping values are fetched from a database using a json file and some ajax to pass the values to the form.
Once the user submits the form a new record is added to a different database, through an api.php file.
